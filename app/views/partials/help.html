	    <p>We are two league of legends fanatics who love everything about the game and as fellow players we are aware of some major issues that players face. To address one of the concerns we decided to build RektGG which gives players the ability to share their experiences with other players. Our end goal is to encourage a more positive game environment. </p>

	            <p>Ever felt like a player was a valuable asset to your team and displayed leadership qualities that carried your team to victory or put up a heroic fight until the end? Sometimes the league of legends honor system does not offer enough to show your respect for a player and so RektGG offers a carry rating system to help summoners identify commendable individuals.</p>
	            <p>Registerd users will also have their own profiles where they may post anything that comes to their minds that they want to share or save, this will be expanded (see "What the future holds").</p>

	            <p>No, the ratings and reviews are strictly informational. The ratings are used to reflect on how well and/or consistent a player is to provide a sort of feedback for the rated player, and his/or teammates. This feedback will help the player realize what he can do to improve or to reassure him/herself that they are on the right track and doing an excellent job.</p>

	            <p>We will allow summoners to link their accounts to their profiles so that they will have the options of both user and summoner.
